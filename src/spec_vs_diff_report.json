However, due to truncation and limited file coverage, it’s not fully evidenced that *all* monetary displays across the entire app (including all totals/summary sections and any other admin/nursery price displays) are converted and that no user-facing \"$\" remains anywhere.",

      "requirement": "Ensure all cart line-item prices, subtotals, and totals render in INR (₹) (not $).",
      "reason": "CartPage changes are truncated; line item price formatting is shown, but the order summary section (where subtotals/totals are typically rendered) is not visible in the diff summary, so full compliance is not evidenced.",
